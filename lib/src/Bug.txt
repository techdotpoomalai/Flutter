The Google Places API price works on a “pay as you go” model. 
You can get a 90-day or $300-credit free trial of the Google Places API if you've 
never used paid services on Google Cloud or the Google Maps Platform 
(which includes the Google Places API). In addition, you get $200 worth of free request
 credits each month.
